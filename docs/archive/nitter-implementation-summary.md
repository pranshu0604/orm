# Nitter Implementation Summary

This document provides a summary of the Nitter scraper implementation in the PRAN system.

## Overview

The Nitter scraper component allows PRAN to retrieve Twitter/X data without requiring direct API access or using browser automation in production.

## Key Components

1. **Instance Discovery**: Finding and validating working Nitter instances
2. **Caching System**: Storing working instances in Redis for performance
3. **Scraping Logic**: Parsing HTML responses from Nitter instances
4. **Fallback Mechanism**: Using multiple instances in case of failures

## Implementation Details

The Nitter scraper system is implemented across several files:

1. **`lib/scrapers/getCachedNitter.ts`**:
   - Retrieves working Nitter instances from Redis cache
   - Handles fallback logic when instances are unavailable

2. **`lib/scrapers/getWorkingNitter.ts`**:
   - Validates Nitter instances to ensure they are operational
   - Updates the cache with newly verified instances

3. **`lib/scrapers/isAlive.ts`**:
   - Checks if a Nitter instance is responsive and functioning
   - Handles timeouts and error conditions

4. **`scripts/update-nitter-instances.js`**:
   - Run via GitHub Actions on a schedule
   - Refreshes the Redis cache with working instances

## Architecture Flow

1. Client requests Twitter/X data
2. System checks Redis cache for working Nitter instances
3. System retrieves data from the first available instance
4. If an instance fails, the system tries the next one in the list
5. Results are parsed and returned to the client

## Limitations

- Only public Twitter/X data is accessible
- Rate limiting on Nitter instances may occur
- Limited to read-only operations

## Future Improvements

- Implement more robust parsing for different content types
- Add support for pagination of tweets
- Improve error handling for edge cases
